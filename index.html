		<h3>Welcome to the accessorie world...</h3>
		I'm definitely a vintage collector. I have a wardrobe of core basics that I like to spice up with different colors, new accessories, and I love to try on new things to invite something different. I find, with every new stage of my life, my self-image shifts with new duties and responsibilities, and so does my fashion style. Our brand celebrates Denmark and the seaside village of Skagen, where the North and Baltic Sea meet. Quality and a sense of purpose are hallmarks of modern Danish design. Our mission is to combine the inspiration of the Danish design perspective with contemporary innovation. We create functional, purposeful, quality products that offer an alternative from a complex world and the ability to connect to simple pleasures.
